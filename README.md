## Usage

Whether using the application on Heroku or on another platform, the user will be presented with the login page for the application. If the user has already set up an account, the user will be redirected to the chat page. If not, the user can click the link in the login box in order to be redirected to the signup page. In the signup page and the login page, prompts will be displayed if certain conditions are not met. In the chat application, the user will be presented with the chat box to communicate with other users. The application is real time so as messages are received, the page will be automatically updated. If the user logouts, they will be redirected back to the login page. The user can remain logged in for 1 day without having to log back in and will be directly redirected to the chat page if they go to the webpage after closing their browser.
